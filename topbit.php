          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>We like to keep web design as simple as possible yet professional. We’ll arrange a meeting either in person or over Skype evaluating your personal needs, design and site preferences for your website. We'll get designing a bespoke professional solution, letting you choose your favourite site design and we’ll smash out the rest of your website for it to be placed live on the web. </p>
